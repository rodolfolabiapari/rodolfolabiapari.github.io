My name is Rodolfo Labiapari Mansur Guimar√£es, and over the years, I have delved deep into the world of Computer Science, specializing in areas such as performance analysis of wearable systems, IoT, and reconfigurable hardware.

From my undergraduate days to completing my master's degree at the Federal University of Ouro Preto, I dedicated myself intensely to research and development of innovative solutions. With applied projects and a CNPq scholarship, I explored different aspects of mobile computing, FPGA, data encryption and Linux Device Drivers.

Professionally, I advanced to the field of Cloud environment architecture, immersed in the DevOps culture. Mastering technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, microservices and GitOps, I developed robust cloud solutions and improved my skills in AWS, Google Cloud Platform and distributed services.

For me, the search for knowledge is a constant. That's why my free time is dedicated to reading, always keeping up to date with market transformations and innovations.
