## Introduction

My name is Rodolfo Labiapari Mansur GuimarÃ£es, and over the years, I have immersed myself in the field of Computer Science, specializing in areas such as performance analysis of wearable systems, IoT, and reconfigurable hardware.

From my undergraduate studies to completing my masterâ€™s degree at the Federal University of Ouro Preto, I dedicated myself intensely to research and the development of innovative solutions. Through applied projects and with the support of a CNPq scholarship, I explored various aspects of mobile computing, FPGA, data encryption, and Linux Device Drivers.

Professionally, I transitioned into the field of Cloud environment architecture, fully embracing the DevOps culture. By mastering technologies such as Kubernetes, Docker, microservices, and GitOps, I have developed robust cloud solutions and enhanced my skills in AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and distributed services.

For me, the pursuit of knowledge is ongoing. That's why my free time is devoted to reading, allowing me to stay abreast of market transformations and innovations.
